fsbext
======

FSB files extractor (extracts from FMOD sound fx archives) 

The code here comes from http://aluigi.altervista.org/search.php?src=fsbext and is the excellent work of aluigi@autistici.org.

At time of fork the fsbext version was listed as 0.3. 

I've forked it here as I couldn't find a compiled version for osx and figured it'd be useful to publish any changes necessary to make it work online.
